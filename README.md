# obsidian_cleanup_images

## Description
This script removes unused images from obsidian vault. It was developed to be run on macOS terminal.

## Intstructions
- Before running the file you need to write the path to your vault in the variable "path_to_vault".
- In order to run the file use on the terminal:
./cleanup_image_obs.sh

## Warning
This code removes the files permanently. I wrote it for my personal use and share it here in case someone finds it useful. It works for me, but it might not work for you.
I advise you to:
- Try the code first commenting the section that deletes the images and check the list of images that the script intends to delete.
- Have a backup copy of your vault before running the script.
